abstract = {The mapping of signalling networks is one of biology's most important goals. However, given their size, complexity and dynamic nature, obtaining comprehensive descriptions of these networks has proven extremely challenging. A fast and cost-effective means to infer connectivity between genes on a systems-level is by quantifying the similarity between high-dimensional cellular phenotypes following systematic gene depletion. This review describes the methodology used to map signalling networks using data generated in the context of RNAi screens.},
