abstract: Characterising context-dependent gene functions is crucial for understanding the genetic bases of health and disease. To date, inference of gene functions from large-scale genetic perturbation screens is based on ad hoc analysis pipelines involving unsuper- vised clustering and functional enrichment. We present Knowl- edge- and Context-driven Machine Learning (KCML), a framework that systematically predicts multiple context-specific functions for a given gene based on the similarity of its perturbation phenotype to those with known function. As a proof of concept, we test KCML on three datasets describing phenotypes at the molecular, cellular and population levels and show that it outperforms traditional analysis pipelines. In particular, KCML identified an abnormal multicellular organisation phenotype associated with the depletion of olfactory receptors, and TGFb and WNT signalling genes in colorectal cancer cells. We validate these predictions in colorectal cancer patients and show that olfactory receptors expression is predictive of worse patient outcomes. These results highlight KCML as a systematic framework for discovering novel scale-crossing and context-dependent gene functions. KCML is highly generalis- able and applicable to various large-scale genetic perturbation screens.

title: "KCML: a machine-learning framework for inference of multi-scale gene functions from genetic perturbation screens"
summary:  "KCML is an intelligent system that allow inference of systematic Inference of multi-scale gene funcitons from genetic screens. It annotate genes with GO terms based on phenotypic similarity. As these annotations are data driven they provide more tissue type-specific gene funcitons."
