abstract: Although a great deal is known about the signaling events that promote nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, how cellular biophysics and the microenvironment might regulate the dynamics of this pathway is poorly understood. In this study, we used high-content image analysis and Bayesian network modeling to ask whether cell shape and context features influence NF-kappaB activation using the inherent variability present in unperturbed populations of breast tumor and non-tumor cell lines. Cellâ€“cell contact, cell and nuclear area, and protrusiveness all contributed to variability in NF-jB localization in the absence and presence of TNFa. Higher levels of nuclear NF-kappaB were associated with mesenchymal-like versus epithelial-like morphologies, and RhoA-ROCK-myosin II signaling was critical for mediating shape-based differences in NF-kappaB localization and oscillations. Thus, mechanical factors such as cell shape and the microenvironment can influence NF-kappaB signaling and may in part explain how different phenotypic outcomes can arise from the same chemical cues.

summary:  Here we show that the physical shape of the cell significantly impact its response to inflammation as reflected by NF-kappaB activation. We measured a total of 77 cell shape and environmental features, such as how close a cell is to its neighbors.  To assess shape we measured features like how round the cells were, the ratio of their length to their width, plus the extent of their protrusions and "ruffliness". Mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells had more NF-kappaB in their nuclei, tended to be larger and more "ruffly", with many more sharp protrusions than epithelial-like cells, which are normally softer-edged and rounder.
