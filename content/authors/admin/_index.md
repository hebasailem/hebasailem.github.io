test I am an independent investigator and Sir Henry Wellcome Fellow at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Big Data Institute at the University of Oxford. I am interested in modelling multi-scale gene functions to understand how functions at the molecular level propagate to cellular, tissue and organ levels. An important factor to consider through such analysis is the effect of the microenvironment and morphology which can modulate signalling through mechanotransduction. This requires developing innovative quantitative imaging methods for modelling biological behaviour at different systems-level and integration of heterogeneous datasets. My work combines methods from Computer Vision, Genetics, Data Science, Bioinformatics and Systems Biology.

While at Oxford I developed an intelligent framework for inferring gene functions from large scale genetic screens. This allowed systematic analysis of these datasets in a way that was not possible before. I also developed multiple deep learning and image analysis algorithms for classifying microscopy imaging data and profiling biological phenotypes at subcellular, cellular and tissue levels. 

I did my PhD at the Institute of Cancer Research in London with Prof Chris Bakal. While at the ICR I developed methods for integrating phenotypic data with gene expression, modelling of the relationship between cell signalling and its context, modelling the dynamics of cell morphogenesis. In these studies, I discovered new links between cell shape and breast cancer progression.

I am also interested in data visualisation and science communication. I devised PhenoPlot, one of the first tool that is specifically designed for visualising phenotypic data. This method facilitates the interpretation of high dimensional data by generating pictorial representations of cells based on hundreds to thousands of measurements.
